       "\"Here's a classic recipe for making croissants:\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\nFor the dough:\\n\\n1. 1 cup warm milk (around 105°F to 115°F)\\n2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar\\n3. 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\\n4. 3 cups all-purpose flour\\n5. 1 teaspoon salt\\n6. 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted\\n\\nFor the butter block:\\n\\n7. 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\\n8. 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Make the dough**\\n\\n1. In a small bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the mixture and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.\\n2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and melted butter.\\n3. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\\n4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-12 minutes, until smooth and elastic.\\n\\n**Step 2: Rest the dough**\\n\\n1. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\\n\\n**Step 3: Make the butter block**\\n\\n1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the softened butter to a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.\\n2. Brush the edges of the butter with confectioners' sugar.\\n\\n**Step 4: Laminate the dough**\\n\\n1. Roll out the rested dough to a large rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.\\n2. Place the butter block on top of the dough, making sure to align the edges.\\n3. Fold the dough over the butter, like a letter, so that the two long sides meet in the middle.\\n4. Rotate the dough 90 degrees, so that the folded edge is facing you.\\n5. Roll out the dough to a large rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.\\n\\n**Step 5: Cut and shape the croissants**\\n\\n1. Use a pastry cutter or a sharp knife to cut the dough into long, thin triangles.\\n2. Cut each triangle in half, so that you have a total of 16-20 triangles.\\n3. Roll each triangle into a croissant shape, starting from the wide end.\\n\\n**Step 6: Proof and bake**\\n\\n1. Place the croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between each one.\\n2. Cover with plastic wrap and let them proof in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.\\n3. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).\\n4. Bake the croissants for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* Keep the butter cold at all times.\\n* Don't overwork the dough or the butter block.\\n* Let the croissants proof long enough to develop a nice layer of gluten.\\n* Bake the croissants when they're still slightly soft in the center.\""
